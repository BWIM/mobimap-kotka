# mobimap-kotka

Welcome! This site gives an overview over the mobility of the city Kotka in southern Finland in September 2024.

## General

For this purpose, the mobility of pedestrians, cyclists and car drivers was analyzed. This was done at the Sustainable Mobility Hackathon at the XAMP-University in Kotka.

The maps were generated by using the valhalla-routing engine to calculate the route from the center of every hexagon to the new campus of the university in Kotka. All the default values were used, except for a walking speed of 3.6 km/h for pedestrians.

## Legend

The legend is missing on the map. The colors mean the following things:

- Dark green (A): 0-15 minutes travel time.
- Light green (B): 16-20 minutes travel time.
- Yellow (C): 21 - 30 minutes travel time.
- Orange (D): 31-45 minutes travel time.
- Red (E): > 45 minutes travel time.
